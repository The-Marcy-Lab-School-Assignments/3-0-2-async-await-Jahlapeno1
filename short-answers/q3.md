# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users";
  const users = await fetch(url)
    .then((r) => r.json())
    .catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUsers();
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

Yes the code will work because `await` does not require a return.

# Teacher Feedback

It works but it isn't because of the return, right now there is an implicit return!
