# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code?

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Fetch failed!");
    response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => console.log(json))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer

The issue is we forgot to return `response.json()` in the first `.then`. For `async/await` we don't need to return it and can just save it to a variable.
